workspace


This project aims to develop a productivity organizer website, customised to my personal liking. The emphasis will be a gamified environment where tasks are presented clearly and compeletion recorded in logs.

Ideal sections to include:
* Journal
* To do list
* Reference to technical resources to aid tasks.
* Incorporation of spaced-repetition algorithm, inspired by anki.
* Online storage drive. 
* "Habit Scorecard" inspired by New York Times Best Seller "Atomic Habits" by James Clear and Mesolimbic Dopamine pathway Reinforcement theory.

The workspace will also provide end-users with a bountiful option of themes.
